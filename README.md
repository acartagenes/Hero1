Hero is a remake of a game that always caught my attention "Space Invaders"! I designed the spaceship and you can move it with the "Up" "Down" "Right" "Left" arrows. My overall goal was to create a storyline, seperated by levels, but to also give you more mobility than the 1978 game. I wanted to keep the pixel aestetic that feels very nostalgic and also still elaborate on the designs, story and game play as well.
